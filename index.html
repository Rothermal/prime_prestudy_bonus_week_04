<p>Take your project and add a 'Splinter' function. The function should take in 2 numbers, multiply them together saved under a locally scoped variable called 'z'. Then create an array that stores the first argument, second argument, and z. Return that array.

Then console log out the Splinter function, passing in 1 and 2.</p>
